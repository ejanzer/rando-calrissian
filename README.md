# March Madness (Weighted) Random Pick Generator aka Rando Calrissian

## Usage

- Get the forecast spread sheet from fivethirtyeight.com and convert to csv
- `python3 rando/picker.py ~/path/to/fivethirtyeight_ncaa_forecasts.csv`
- Open up your bracket and go to the first contest
- Look up the team ids in the csv and enter when prompted (yes this is super annoying)
- The script will make your pick for you. Enter it in your bracket!
- Repeat forever.

## TODO

This could obviously be a lot less manual.
